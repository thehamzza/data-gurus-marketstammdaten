Data Gurus Market Data Management

I spearheaded the development of an ETL pipeline, focusing on parsing XML files and integrating them into Databricks using PySpark. 
I optimized the entire process, making it faster and less resource-intensive, thereby enhancing data processing efficiency and scalability for market data management. 
This project showcased my ability to streamline data workflows and improve system performance in a big data environment.
